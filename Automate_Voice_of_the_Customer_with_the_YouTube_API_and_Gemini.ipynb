BMW proves this and it is a CRIME that they are still in bidness. Talk about transference of wealth from owners to parts manufacturers and BMW dealer service departments. It is ALL SO OBVIOUS, but American owners, like ALL BMW owners, have ZERO representation in CONGRESS or in the average American courtroom, save for those who are in the top 1% wealthiest. So as the buyer, you are supposed to KNOW that buying a BMW INCLUDES several thousands more for constant repairs. So buyer beware, because BMW has absolutely NO LEGAL DUTY to make ANYTHING of good quality and reliability. This is because wherever you are in this f-d up world, WHOMEVER HAS THE MOST MONEY rules the courts and owns the judges. That is NOT YOU. That is OLIVER ZIPSHITZ, the current BMW CEO.

The U.S. market also doesn't get the Integral Active Steering, 4-wheel steering, and anti-roll stabilizer.  We also don't get the Digital 4-Zone Rear Climate Control, M Style Seat belts, and front massage seats.  Lastly, it is truly disappointing that BMW decided to get rid of the door sills.  I enjoyed the door sills, especially the illuminated ones.  Come of BMW, even the Honda Accord has them.  In my opinion, the BMW has gone cheap, we get less, but pay a lot more.  Cheap plastic door panels, hard dashboards, cheap plastic window switches, and no Matrix LED lights.                                                                                                                                       |\\n| 136 | Nice toothpaste commercial.

BMW proves this and it is a CRIME that they are still in bidness. Talk about transference of wealth from owners to parts manufacturers and BMW dealer service departments. It is ALL SO OBVIOUS, but American owners, like ALL BMW owners, have ZERO representation in CONGRESS or in the average American courtroom, save for those who are in the top 1% wealthiest. So as the buyer, you are supposed to KNOW that buying a BMW INCLUDES several thousands more for constant repairs. So buyer beware, because BMW has absolutely NO LEGAL DUTY to make ANYTHING of good quality and reliability. This is because wherever you are in this f-d up world, WHOMEVER HAS THE MOST MONEY rules the courts and owns the judges. That is NOT YOU. That is OLIVER ZIPSHITZ, the current BMW CEO.

Rock the new i5, BMW <3 Can't wait to see it in person\"\n*   \"I love my 5 series anyway, but this looks incredible üòÆ\"\n*   \"The new era of innovation! Well done BMW, that's why you're the best!\"\n*   \"Beautiful work, now the 5 series takes the crown on its category 1000000% ‚ù§\"\n\n**Negative Sentiment (approx. 20%):**  Negative comments focus on specific issues like design preferences, feature availability in certain markets (like Australia), past experiences with BMW, comparisons with competitors (Tesla, Mercedes), and concerns about the brand's direction.\n\n**Example Comments:**\n\n*   \"Dont trust in  bmw advertise because they not working at all. I buy new a bmw 5 g30 5  years ago  and the advertise was idrive amd 3 d maps but steel today they dont work in my car amd in any bmw car in balkan.\"\n*   \"BMW didn't get the memo that car thieves steal cars by accessing the car owner's key Pod with electronic key pod scanners.\"\n*   \"Are these features actually going to be available in the Australian cars or are you just going to switch them off like you did with the i4s lane change assist? I know that wasn't about the laws here because my wife's 2021 Merc has it...\"\n*   \"This is only available in USA and Germany for now\"\n\n**Neutral Sentiment (approx. 20%):** Neutral comments include expressions of desire for the car, simple statements of fact, or requests for more information.\n\n**Example Comments:**\n\n*   \"Come to brazil, please!! üòçüòç\"\n*   \"BMW, what are you doing  ?!?!  you forget about your main family trait. you forget about genetics - this is a classic chassis layout! make the classic layout more pronounced, move the front axle forward.  BMW, good luck to you !\"\n*   \"Optional upgrade?\"\n*   \"I am planning on getting an M3 comp, but now I want an i7.\"\n\n## Recommendations for Future Campaigns\n\n**Keep Doing:**\n\n1.  **Showcase Innovation:** The positive response to the i5's technology suggests a continued focus on highlighting innovative features in future campaigns.\n2.  **High-Quality Production:** Many comments praise the campaign's visuals and overall quality. Maintaining this standard will be crucial.\n3.  **Engage with Enthusiasts:**  Respond to comments and questions, especially from those expressing interest in the i5 or BMW in general.\n\n**Avoid Doing:**\n\n1.  **Overlooking Regional Concerns:** Address concerns about feature availability in specific markets directly to avoid alienating potential customers.\n2.  **Ignoring Criticisms:** While positive sentiment is high, address recurring criticisms (e.g., design language, comparisons with competitors) to mitigate negative perceptions.\n3.  **Misrepresenting Features:** Ensure that advertised features are accurate and available, as misleading information can severely damage trust. \n"
