In a life-freshet, over the land of thy sires,
Thou hast flooded and poured, unabated.

Thou has flooded and poured, in a bright tale of life,
Through field, woodland, hill and vale streaming...
From thy native flower-copses thy crown is made bright,
Like a swan' plumage, brilliant gleaming.

Thou dost quiver and echo with songs of the bards,
Long-past years thou dost raise up and nurture,
Today's forward leap thou wouldst never retard,
Boldly facing mysterious futures.

In the sun thou goest bold, lovely flower of fire,
Gently sowing forth dreams, gold-adornéd;
Thou fearest no neighbour, though great be his ire,
Thou fearest no path briared and thorny.

From end unto end, frontier mound unto mound,
On the breezes renewal is borne now,
And, embracing the soul, without limit or bound,
Mother-joy for the better day born now.

Now there are no axes among forests green,
Felling young pine-trees in frosty winter,
Now there are no reapers from dawn to dark seen
In summer with scythes ringing, glinting.

Strength is known in the hands, without tears songs are blithe,
Desirous of glory, breasts quiver,
In their books a new law, with pens of sun-scythes,
New people are writing for ever.

Blossom them, and raise, soaring upon eagle's wing,
Souls, hearts and thoughts slumbering dully,
Awaken and forth into great spaces, bring
Strength by the witch-noose unsullied.

Send messengers forth, send unto the world's bound,
As falcon from falcon-nest winging.
Let them fly, fly away unto warriors sound,
Set the thunder of good news far-ringing.

Enough, dearest country, in field, wood and brake,
Hapless orphan, thou spendst night's long glowering,
Enough of thy heart's-blood wrong drank as a snake,
And cold winds blew, through thy bare bones scouring.

that bound her to foreign power;
she let loose her own flag to the wind
and founded the empire of law.

Liberty proclaimed enthusiastically,
Liberty in order and good;
she girded the garland of progress
on her virgin and innocent temple!

tried to submit her to the yoke,
outraged, the peoples rose up,

wanted to give us happiness and peace

Constant and active work
gave the people, generous, bread

Of the right of the people, the guardian.

The greed of jealous brothers
agitated in constant restlessness:
let us not consciously live
in peace, progress and light;

And they challenge us to a fratricidal fight
preparing the traitorous arquebus;
Come, then, so that injustice never
will overcome our noble attitude!

The cannon that in San Juan and San Jorge
once made the dust bite
the intruder bandit from the North,
its blast prepares again;

If the bloodthirsty clarion resounds,
Costa Rica, with noble pride,
'War, war' will say its horns,
""Citizens, death or victory!""

And from the sea and the meadow and the forest,
From the desert and settlement, the voice
Has been heard by the distant horizon
Repeating: ""Never! Invader!""

""Our soil does not mark the plant
of a fierce cowardly alliance,
As long as the holy spark shines,
in the people, of warlike ardour""

As long as Guardia, the hardened soldier,
Outlines the duty of the people to the people,
even if the fatherland finds itself in danger,
It can keep its honour and his faith;

Hail oh Guardia, brave and patriotic!
Hail, oh Guardia, of heroic pride!
Hail, oh Guardia, your honour and your glories

Where the genius of Sanchez and Duarte
Taught us to be free or to die.

Reduce the luster of these glories,

The arrogant lion from Castile,
Removes it from glorious beaches to

But it will never be again enslaved.

Where one feels the homeland lives;

Crossed by a block, by a block of snow;
And seen on its sacred background
Are five stars of pale blue;
On your emblem, which a roaring sea
Shields with its rough waves,
Behind the bare summit of a volcano, of a volcano,
There is a star, there is a star of clear light.
A virgin and beautiful Indian, you were sleeping
To the resonant song of your seas,
When thrown into your basins of gold
The bold navigator found you;
And looking at your beauty, ecstatic
At the ideal influence of your charm,
The blue hem of your splendid mantle
He consecrated with his kiss of love.

From a country where the sun rises,
Beyond the blue Atlantean,
That man had dreamt of you
And in search of you launched himself into the sea.
When you raised your pale forehead,
In the lively anxiety of your longing,
Under the gentle dome of your sky
A foreign banner was already floating.

It was useless that the Indian, your beloved,
Prepare to fight with ire,
Because, enveloped in his blood, Lempira
Sank into the deep night;
And of the epic feat, in memory,
The legend alone has kept
From a tomb the unknown place
And the harsh profile of a crag.

For three centuries your children listened
To the imperative mandate of the master;
For three centuries your useless complaint
Was lost in the blue atmosphere;
But one glorious day your ear
Perceived, powerful and distant,
That far away, over the Atlante,
A Lion roared indignantly.

Chorus

V
It was France, the free, the heroic,
That in her sleep of centuries asleep
Awoke angry to life
At the virile complaint of Danton:
It was France, that sent to death
The head of the consecrated King,
And that raised proud at his side,
The altar of the goddess reason.

Chorus

VI
You too, oh my fatherland!, arose
From your servile and deep sleep;
You also taught the world
The infamous shattered link.
And in your blessed soil, behind the tall
Hair of the wild jungle,
Like a bird of black plumage,
The fleeting colony was lost.

Chorus

VII
To keep that divine emblem,
Let us march, oh fatherland, to death,
Generous will be our fate,
If we die thinking of your love.
Defending your holy flag
And covered in your glorious folds,
There will be many, Honduras, of your dead,
But all will fall with honour."

Of a German and ancient line,

Faith to this land of mine.
A prince I am, undaunted,
Of Orange, ever free,
To the king of Spain I've granted
A lifelong loyalty.

I've ever tried to live in
The fear of God's command
And therefore I've been driven,
From people, home, and land,
But God, I trust, will rate me
His willing instrument
And one day reinstate me
Into my government.

Let no despair betray you,
My subjects true and good.
The Lord will surely stay you
Though now you are pursued.
He who would live devoutly
Must pray God day and night
To throw His power about me
As champion of your right.

Life and my all for others
I sacrificed, for you!
And my illustrious brothers
Proved their devotion too.
Count Adolf, more's the pity,
Fell in the Frisian fray,
And in the eternal city
Awaits the judgement day.

I, nobly born, descended
From an imperial stock.
An empire's prince, defended
(Braving the battle's shock
Heroically and fearless
As pious Christian ought)
With my life's blood the peerless
Gospel of God our Lord.

A shield and my reliance,
O God, Thou ever wert.
I'll trust unto Thy guidance.
O leave me not ungirt.
That I may stay a pious
Servant of Thine for aye
And drive the plagues that try us
And tyranny away.

My God, I pray thee, save me
From all who do pursue
And threaten to enslave me,
Thy trusted servant true.
O Father, do not sanction
Their wicked, foul design,
Don't let them wash their hands in
This guiltless blood of mine.

O David, thou soughtest shelter
From King Saul's tyranny.
Even so I fled this welter
And many a lord with me.
But God the Lord did save me
From exile and its hell
And, in His mercy, gave him
A realm in Israel.

Fear not 't will rain sans ceasing
The clouds are bound to part.
I bide that sight so pleasing
Unto my princely heart,
Which is that I with honor
Encounter death in war,
And meet in heaven my Donor,
His faithful warrior.

Nothing so moves my pity
As seeing through these lands,
Field, village, town and city
Pillaged by roving hands.
O that the Spaniards rape thee,
My Netherlands so sweet,
The thought of that does grip me
Causing my heart to bleed.

A stride on steed of mettle
I've waited with my host
The tyrant's call to battle,
Who durst not do his boast.
For, near Maastricht ensconced,
He feared the force I wield.
My horsemen saw one bounce it
Bravely across the field.

Surely, if God had willed it,
When that fierce tempest blew,
My power would have stilled it,
Or turned its blast from you
But He who dwells in heaven,
Whence all our blessings flow,
For which aye praise be given,
Did not desire it so.

Steadfast my heart remaineth
In my adversity
My princely courage straineth
All nerves to live and be.
I've prayed the Lord my Master
With fervid heart and tense
To save me from disaster
And prove my innocence.

Alas! my flock. To sever
Is hard on us. Farewell.
Your Shepherd wakes, wherever
Dispersed you may dwell,
Pray God that He may ease you.
His Gospel be your cure.
Walk in the steps of Jesu
This life will not endure.

Unto the Lord His power
I do confession make
That ne'er at any hour
Ill of the King I spake.
But unto God, the greatest
Of Majesties I owe
Obedience first and latest,
For Justice wills it so."

Sweet Fatherland, in this manner you show yourself.
In your ensign one sees the colors
Of sapphire, diamond, and ruby.
In your coat of arms, which the Sun illuminates,
Under the cap, one sees the lion.
Double image of the strong and the free,
And of glories, the memory and crest.


From the tomb of vile feudalism
The national Deity rises free;
Oppressors, bend your knees!
Compatriots, entone the hymn!
Sound the cry, ""Republic or death""!
Our breasts exhale it with faith,
And the mountains repeat its echoes
Like giants arising in the land.


Our Fatherland defends liberty and justice;
So tyrants: listen!
The laws in its sacred charter
Will sustain its heroism in the fight.
Against the world, if the world opposes it,
If the world dares to insult her security,
Battling to avenge we shall know her
Or die embracing her.


Arise, oh People, your splendid sword
That strikes with sparkles of God,
There is no middle ground between free or slave
And an abyss divides the two.
In the gentle breezes the Hymn resounds,
Repeating with triumphal echo:
For the free, renowned glory!
For the Fatherland, immortal laurel!"

And may their noble sound prevail thunderously across my eternal homeland.


For only then, shall my fatigued tombstone, if there is one, prostrate[xi] a thousand times in ecstasy,
And tears of blood shall, oh Lord, spill out from my every wound,
And my lifeless body shall burst forth from the earth like an eternal spirit,
Perhaps only then, shall I peacefully ascend and at long last reach the heavens.[xii]

Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there:

On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,
In fully glory reflected now shines in the stream:

From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Between their loved home and the war's desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land

And their captive plants lay

Given the dogma that May inspired
Among free despots fierce
A bridge saw pit.

On his chest shield in battle,
In his superb courage trembled
The feudal champions of the Cid
In the valleys, mountains and jungles
Are undertaken with silent pride,
With fierce rumbling roar
The caves and the sky at once.

And vicious beating palms
Her skeleton, revenge! shouted

It electrified in martial fire,
And in his teaching more lively shines
Of the Incas the immortal God.

Disputing the bloody earth
Inch by inch with blind fury.

Tamed the wrath of a king;
And to the world the indomitable Homeland
Inaugurates teaches law.

Removing his late fury
Avoid fratricidal strife,

And the triumphant worship free

Neither foot oppressors imposed

Of the sun of this new republic
With glimpses of purple and gold,
Decks your beautiful glow.

With stars in the heavens writes,
Sweet Fatherland, your name immortal.

Sacrificing their divine order
Blind hatred, and black ambition.
And find that insulting fierce

For the enemies, the spear of Mars,
For the tyrants the dagger of Brutus!
